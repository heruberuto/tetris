# Shipping Instructions for Client-Side Tetris

1. Build a fully client-side game: use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript so the game runs entirely in the browser with no server logic.
2. Keep deployment simple: output static files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) that can be hosted on any static file server (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a local `python -m http.server`).
3. Prefer a single canvas for rendering and keep state in memory to avoid external dependencies.
4. Include keyboard controls, scoring, level/speed scaling, and a pause/reset flow to make the game complete.
5. Document how to run the game locally and how to deploy it as static files.
